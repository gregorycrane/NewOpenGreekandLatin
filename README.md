# NewOpenGreekandLatin

This is a place to put random pieces of Greek or Latin that need to be added to Open Greek and Latin. I started this repository when I discovered in 2024 that we had paid to have Procopius entered in 2014 but had not updated the format. This is in beta code and the markup needs to be updated.
